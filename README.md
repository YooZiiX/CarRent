# CarRent

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using different librairy such as [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build a Car Rental Application.

The main goal of this project is to practice the new Server-side Rendering and App Router from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Application.

I Followed the [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)'s [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/pUNSHPyVryU?si=3y4dQ9sSKVkrDBGU), taking a few liberties.

The functionalities implemented in this project are as follows :

- Advanced Search Functionality
- Create Filtering Capabilities
- Optimize Metadata and SEO
- Custom Button, Combobox, and Modal Element

I achieved this thanks to a <b>well-organized project</b> and used the principles of <b>clean code writing</b>.

The next functionalities to be implemented are <b>User authentification</b>, <b>Rental system</b>, etc.
