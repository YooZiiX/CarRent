# CarRent

This is a [<b>Next.js</b>](https://nextjs.org/) project using different librairy such as [<b>React</b>](https://react.dev/) and [<b>TailwindCSS</b>](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build a Car Rental Application.

The main goal of this project is to practice the new <b>Server-side Rendering</b> and <b>App Router</b> from [<b>Next.js</b>](https://nextjs.org/) Application.
But also to learn <b>TypeScript</b>.

I followed the [<b>JavaScript Mastery</b>](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)'s [<b>YouTube video</b>](https://youtu.be/pUNSHPyVryU?si=3y4dQ9sSKVkrDBGU), taking a few liberties.

The functionalities implemented in this project are as follows :

- Advanced Search Functionality
- Create Filtering Capabilities
- Optimize Metadata and SEO
- Custom Button, Combobox, and Modal Element

I achieved this thanks to a <b>well-organized project</b> and used the principles of <b>clean code writing</b>.

The next functionalities to be implemented are <b>User authentification</b>, <b>Rental system</b>, etc.

## Various pages

Currently, there is only a Landing page with the display of cars, which are the results of searches and filters.

## ENV File example (./.env)
