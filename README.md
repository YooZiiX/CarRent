# CarRent

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using different librairy such as [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build this Car Rental Application.

The functionalities implemented in this project are as follows :

- Advanced Search Functionality
- Create Filtering Capabilities
- Optimize Metadata and SEO
- Custom Button, Combobox, and Modal Element

I achieved this thanks to a well-organized project and used the principles of clean code writing.
