# CarRent.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using different librairy such as [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build this Car Rental Application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
